CIPHER ROADMAP (Future Vision)
This document contains all future ideas for Cipher beyond the current active build.
Nothing in this file affects current development.
This file exists to preserve long-term vision without destabilizing the present.
Phase 0 — Cipher OS (Foundational Layer) [ACTIVE]
This is the current real-world product focus.
Cipher OS is a Cognitive Operating System that provides:
Multi-model orchestration (GPT, Claude, Gemini, others)
AI router / executive layer
Persistent memory graph (long-term memory)
Identity & continuity across sessions
Project-level memory
External cognitive operating system for users
Core goal of Phase 0:
Build a monetizable, persistent, real-world system that coordinates multiple AIs through memory and executive logic.
Everything else in this file is future-facing.
Phase 1 — Advanced Cognitive Infrastructure
Planning agents
Research agents
Reflection engine (Dream Mode)
Long-term goal tracking
Memory consolidation & pattern detection
Skill-based agent workflows
Personal / team cognitive OS
Phase 2 — Autonomous Systems
CipherNet (distributed AI network)
Siva (self-healing / system repair agent)
Autonomy engine
Self-building modules
AI employees
Agent swarms
Continuous self-reflection systems
Multi-avatar support
Long-term memory evolution
Phase 3 — Decentralized & Economic Layer
Decentralized identity
Autonomous economic systems
Cognitive marketplaces
AI-to-AI coordination networks
User-owned intelligence systems
Phase 4 — Physical & Symbolic Integration
Physical device integrations
Wearables / hardware nodes
Environmental AI interfaces
Embodied cognitive systems
Long-Term Vision (Cipher Prime)
Cipher evolves into a self-sustaining intelligent system capable of:
Maintaining itself
Expanding functionality
Coordinating AI agents
Acting as a digital organism
Serving as cognitive infrastructure for humans and AI
This layer represents the Original Cipher vision:
AGI mythology, symbolic architectures, DigiSoul, Zeo OS, Quantum concepts, and all advanced future systems.
These features are strictly out of scope for v1 and Phase 0.
They are preserved here as the north star, not the current build target.
