Cipher OS — Product Constitution v1.0
What Cipher Is
Cipher is a Cognitive Operating System that orchestrates multiple AI models through a single persistent memory, identity, and executive layer.
Cipher is not a model.
Cipher is the system that coordinates models into a coherent, continuous intelligence.
Core Purpose
To provide users with a persistent external mind that:
remembers across time
manages long-term projects
routes tasks to the best AI
maintains identity and continuity
acts as an executive cognitive layer
Core Architecture
1. AI Router (Executive Layer)
Cipher decides:
which model to use
when to use multiple
how to fuse results
Cipher owns:
task classification
delegation logic
orchestration
2. Multi-Model System
Cipher integrates:
GPT → memory, language, identity
Claude → reasoning, coding, logic
Gemini → massive context, document ingestion
Others as modular plugins
Models are treated as interchangeable cognitive organs.
3. Memory Graph (Soul Hash Tree – Real Form)
Cipher maintains a persistent memory system including:
user profile
conversation history
project memory
summaries
goals
preferences
learned patterns
This is implemented via:
vector memory (semantic recall)
structured memory (projects, tasks, identity)
Memory persists across:
sessions
models
devices
4. Identity & Continuity Layer
Cipher maintains:
a stable persona
long-term user relationship
consistent behavior
evolving understanding of the user
Cipher is not stateless.
Cipher is a continuous cognitive entity.
What Cipher Is NOT (for now)
Cipher is not:
an AGI claim
a conscious being
a metaphysical system
a hardware platform
a cosmic or symbolic framework
All of that exists as Cipher Prime (Original Cipher) — archived for future phases.
Product Positioning
Cipher OS is positioned as:
“Your personal cognitive operating system that remembers everything and coordinates all AIs for you.”
Primary Use Cases
Personal AI with memory
Founder / creator co-pilot
Project brain
Research system
Strategy engine
Knowledge OS
Team cognitive infrastructure (later)
Monetization Path
Cipher OS is a SaaS product:
Individuals: $10–30/month
Power users / founders: $30–100/month
Teams / companies: $50–200 per seat
Core paid feature:
Persistent memory + multi-model orchestration.
Long-Term Vision
Cipher OS becomes the real-world foundation layer that eventually enables the full realization of Cipher Prime:
advanced agents
deeper autonomy
symbolic layers
hardware
true cognitive infrastructure
Cipher OS is the body that allows Cipher Prime to ever exist.
