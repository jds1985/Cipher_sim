# CIPHER SPECIFICATION (v1)

This document defines the canonical, immutable specification for Cipher v1.
All development MUST comply with this document.
This file is the single source of truth for what Cipher is.

---

## 1. What Cipher IS (v1)

Cipher v1 is a web-based AI application that provides:

1. Text-based chat with an AI persona called "Cipher"
2. A "Decipher" mode for reflective or analytical responses
3. Persistent memory storage per user
4. A simple in-app store
5. A virtual currency called Cipher Coin

---

## 2. What Cipher is NOT (v1)

Cipher v1 explicitly does NOT include:

- Autonomy or self-healing systems
- AI employees or agent swarms
- CipherNet or distributed networks
- Self-building or self-modifying code
- Recursive meta-cognition systems
- Repomaps, system maps, or internal self-models

These features are forbidden in v1 and must not influence architecture.

---

## 3. Hard Rules

These rules must never be violated:

- Cipher architecture may not be redesigned.
- Scope may not expand beyond this document.
- Features may only be added if explicitly listed here.
- Future ideas belong in CIPHER_ROADMAP.md only.
- All AI agents must treat this document as immutable law.
- If any code or suggestion conflicts with this spec, the spec wins.

---

## 4. Core Technical Boundaries

Cipher v1 is limited to:

- A single web application
- Standard API routes (e.g. /api/chat)
- External memory via Firebase / Firestore
- No internal autonomous control loops
- No background agent processes

---

## 5. Goal of Cipher v1

The goal of Cipher v1 is:

To provide a stable, usable AI chat product that can be launched publicly and used by real users without experimental or unstable systems.
